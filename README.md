# digitalplatform visualization tool
For my master thesis, I created a reference model to support the creation process of digital platform. 
The reference model contains Enterprise Architecture (EA) patterns to describe seven viewpoints.
These viewpoints cover the motivation, bussiness, application, and data elements of a digital platform. 

The visualization tool allows to use the identified concepts within these viewpoints to create a digital platform. 
The tool contains an introduction sheet and seven viewpoints. Each viewpoint contains the identified concepts, related questions to fill in these concepts, and an ArchiMate picture of the meta-model. 
By the use of natural language one can use the visualization tool to create a digital platform.
